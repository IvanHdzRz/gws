    <!-- Unlike the other ListViews used throughout the app, this one does not make use of CachingStrategy="RecycleElement", which was a fix for VORET-546.
    VORET-546 wasn't directly reproducible, however google searches indicated that using the RecycleElement caching strategy was a rememdy for the exception seen
    in that ticket. The reason this ListView does not use RecycleElement as a caching strategy is because we were seeing an undesired symptom: In this list, we
    highlight the first item via the ListView.SelectedItem property to show the user the current item they are on for a given order picking order. 
    With RecycleElement used, this highlight was not showing. This issue has been captured in VORET-557.-->
